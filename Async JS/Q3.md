### **Q3: What is the Same-Origin Policy in the Context of AJAX Requests, and How to Work Around It?**

#### **Same-Origin Policy**:

The **same-origin policy** is a security feature implemented in web browsers that restricts scripts on a webpage from making requests to a different domain, protocol, or port than the one that served the webpage. This is designed to prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive data from other sites through unauthorized cross-origin requests.

#### **Working Around the Same-Origin Policy**:

1. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:

   - The server being accessed can include special HTTP headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to allow cross-origin requests.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // Server-side (e.g., Node.js with Express)
     app.use((req, res, next) => {
       res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); // Allow all origins
       next();
     });
     ```

2. **JSONP (JSON with Padding)**:

   - Allows cross-origin requests by embedding `<script>` tags that load JSON data from another domain. This is limited to `GET` requests and is largely obsolete now.

3. **Proxy Servers**:

   - Use a proxy server (hosted on the same origin) to forward requests to the target server.

4. **WebSockets**:

   - WebSockets bypass the same-origin policy as they are a different protocol (not HTTP).

5. **Using `iframe` with PostMessage**:
   - Use an `iframe` to embed a resource and communicate with it using the `postMessage` API.
