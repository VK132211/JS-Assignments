Purpose of Declaring Variables in JavaScript:
The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve a memory location for storing data values that
can be used throughout a program. Variables act as placeholders for data, making it easier to work with and
manipulate information in your code. Declaring variables allows you to:

1. Variables can store various types of data, such as numbers, text, and objects.
2. You can perform operations on the data stored in variables, such as calculations,
   concatenations, and comparisons.
3. Variables enable you to reuse values at different points in your code, reducing redundancy.
4. Variables can be used to control the flow of your program through conditions and loops.

Declaring Variables using the 'let' Keyword:
In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the 'let' keyword. Here's the basic syntax for declaring a variable
`let variableName;`
```
let age; // Declaration
age = 30; // Initialization
```

`let name = "John"; // Declaration and initialization`
